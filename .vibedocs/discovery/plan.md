- [ ] Create score display updates

### 3.2 Lives System
- [ ] Implement lives counter (start with 3)
- [ ] Add life loss on missed aliens
- [ ] Create game over condition when lives = 0
- [ ] Add lives display in UI

### 3.3 Game Timer and Difficulty
- [ ] Implement game timer tracking
- [ ] Add difficulty scaling every 30 seconds
- [ ] Create linear spawn rate increases
- [ ] Implement alien visibility duration decreases

## Phase 4: User Interface (Medium Priority)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### 4.1 HUD Elements
- [ ] Create score display (top-left)
- [ ] Add lives counter with visual indicators
- [ ] Implement game timer display
- [ ] Add current difficulty level indicator

### 4.2 Game States UI
- [ ] Design start screen with instructions
- [ ] Create game over screen with final score
- [ ] Add restart prompt and instructions
- [ ] Implement UI state transitions

### 4.3 Visual Effects
- [ ] Add click animation on successful hits
- [ ] Create explosion effect for alien destruction
- [ ] Implement alien fade-in/fade-out animations
- [ ] Add visual feedback for missed aliens

## Phase 5: Visual Polish (Medium Priority)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### 5.1 Space Theme Background
- [ ] Create starfield background
- [ ] Add twinkling star animations
- [ ] Implement space color scheme (dark blues/purples)
- [ ] Add subtle background movement

### 5.2 Alien Design
- [ ] Design 3-4 distinct geometric alien shapes
- [ ] Add color variations for different alien types
- [ ] Implement smooth spawn/despawn transitions
- [ ] Create alien hover/idle animations

### 5.3 UI Styling
- [ ] Style score and lives displays
- [ ] Add game fonts and typography
- [ ] Create button styles for start/restart
- [ ] Implement responsive text sizing

## Phase 6: Testing and Optimization (Medium Priority)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### 6.1 Performance Testing
- [ ] Test 60fps performance on target Chrome browser
- [ ] Optimize rendering loop for smooth gameplay
- [ ] Memory usage testing and cleanup
- [ ] Click response time validation

### 6.2 Game Balance Testing
- [ ] Test difficulty progression curve
- [ ] Validate scoring system feels rewarding
- [ ] Check alien spawn/despawn timing
- [ ] Ensure game length is appropriate

### 6.3 Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Test rapid clicking behavior
- [ ] Validate boundary conditions
- [ ] Test configuration loading failures
- [ ] Browser compatibility verification
